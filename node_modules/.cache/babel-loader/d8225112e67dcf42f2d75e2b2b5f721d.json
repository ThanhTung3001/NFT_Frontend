Payment of Fees</div>\n            <div class=\"list-content\">\n              You consent to pay any fees or taxes that you or anyone else using an account that is registered to you may incur. Rise of Immortals may, at any given time, alter the cost of the Virtual Items made available through the Service. You acknowledge that Rise of Immortals is not obligated to give a refund for any reason and that you will not be compensated financially or otherwise for unused virtual goods when an account is closed, regardless of whether it was voluntary or involuntary.\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"list-sub-title\">5.3 FEES AND PAYMENT</div>\n            <div class=\"list-content\">\n              A. Any financial transactions you engage in will only be made over the Ethereum blockchain (Layer 2 Immutable X) compatible networks if you choose to buy, trade, or breed Rise of Immortals NFT on the App, with other users, or via the App. We won't know about or be able to influence any payments or transactions, and we also lack the power to stop any of them. In light of this, you should be aware that we won't be liable for any claims or damages that come from any transactions you carry out using the App, using Smart Contracts, or carrying out any other transactions using the Ethereum blockchain (Layer 2 Immutable X) compatible networks. This goes for both you and any third parties.\n              <br />\n              <br />\n              B. On the Ethereum blockchain (Layer 2 Immutable X) compatible networks, Ethereum needs the payment of a transaction charge (a \"Gas Fee\") for each transaction that takes place. The Gas Fee supports the decentralized Ethereum blockchain (Layer 2 Immutable X) computer network. This means that a Gas Fee will be charged for each transaction made via the site.\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"list-title\">6. Updates to the Service</div>\n            <div class=\"list-content\">\n              You are aware that the Service is constantly changing. You might need to agree to updates to the Service and any Rise of Immortals games you have downloaded onto your device or computer from Rise of Immortals. You understand and agree that Rise of Immortals has the right to\n              <br />\n              <br />\n              update the Service and Rise of Immortals games at any time, with or without prior notice.
